# Pupil Units


## Description
This path is used by the pupils to view the resources and plans for the units that they have been assigned to.

## Flow.

After signing in, a pupil can navigate to /pupil-lessons/pupil_id to see a list of units that have been assigned to the groups that a pupil belongs to.

Units are grouped by Subject and are in order of date the first lesson has been assigned; ties are broken alphabetically by unit name. Subjects with no units show an empty state. Lessons within a unit follow the unit's defined lesson order (not by date).

For each unit, the pupil can see a list of active lessons (published/active status).  Every active lesson appears even if it has no media.  For each lesson, the pupil can see the title, LO (only) and any images (Display Image activities) or files (files linked to the lesson).  Images are displayed as a thumbnail and can be viewed in full screen mode by clicking (single-image modal, no gallery navigation).  All linked files are shown as thumbnails; non-image files use a file-type thumbnail and download directly when clicked.

The lesson title will link to the /pupil-lessons/pupil_id/lessons/lesson_id path when the pupil is enrolled in the lesson; otherwise the title renders without a link.
