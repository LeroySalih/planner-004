## Purpose
The purpose of this page is to allow teachers and pupils to provide data about their profiles.

## Page Components

### Profile Data Panel
The profile data panel will have the following fields:
- Email
- First Name
- Last Name
- Teacher Account (read only), displays whether the profile is linked to a teacher or not.
- Save changes Button.  When the user clicks the save changes button, the button should display a spinner to show the process in running.  The button and the fields should be disabled while the update process is running.
- If the update process is sucessful, notify the user using a toast.
- If an error occures, notify the user using an error toast.

### Other Components
- There is a button to allow the user to navigate to group memberships, which links to the profiles/groups page.


## General Guidance.
Where possible, components should be pure server components.
